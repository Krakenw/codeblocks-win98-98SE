
The 2 zip files are recent codeblock builds (2024) of v1.0 RC2 & v8.02 ANSI using later versions of wxWidgets.

This was done to get around some existing bugs.

Codeblocks 1.0-RC2  would not remember more than 1 user added compiler when compiled with wxWidgets 2.6.1

CB 1.0RC2 (wx264).7z is compiled with wxWidgets 2.6.4 and now remembers more that 1 added compiler.


Codeblocks 8.02 win32 ansi when compiled with wxWidgets 2.8.7 would keep crashing when running on windows 98SE on a real hardware pc.  codeblocks-8.02-win32-ansi-wx2812  is compiled with wxWidgets 2.8.12 and so far has not crashed on my PC.
